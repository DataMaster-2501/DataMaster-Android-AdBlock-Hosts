# DataMaster-Android-AdBlock-Hosts

I made this list by hand to fight the ever growing Ads within Android Apps & Websites.<br>
I hate the fact that the Internet is turning into one big billboard!!! <br>
I started work on this list back in 2012 & over the years I thought why not share it with everyone.<br>

My message to Android Developers is: <br>
If you want to make moneyüí∞ then make people pay for your App.<br>
If you want to make the App free then make it free with no Ads you Greedy Pigsüê∑!!!!<br>
I'm in Control of what shows up on my screen let it be on my Phone or my PC....

This AdBlock /etc/hosts file is made for Android & Linux. <br>
With Android & Linux you can't use the wildcard character * in the /etc/hosts file for Android & Linux, <br>
that only works in Microsoft Windows OS. <br>
So for example 0.0.0.0       *.example.com <br>
would only work on Microsoft Windows OS. <br>
So in Android & Linux you have to list the domain name & every subdomain name as well.üôÑ <br>
As far as I know you have to be rooted on Android to be able to write to the /etc/hosts file<br>
but if you have Root on your phone then find a root file browser app & copy over my hosts file.

You can import my list into the blokada App-> https://blokada.org/index.html You Don't Need Root For Blokada. <br>
Just add this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataMaster-2501/DataMaster-Android-AdBlock-Hosts/master/hosts to blokada & you will always get fresh updates made to the list. <br>
Also this list will work with AdClear but there is no import list option from what I can see in AdClear.

This list blocks Ads/Marketing Services, Analytics/Tracking Services as well some malicious & harmful domains. <br>
I feel the Analytics/Tracking Services that are added into Android Apps is a big privacy problem. <br>
With this list you can block Ads within Android Apps & On Websites. <br>
This file is setup for both IPv4 & IPv6. <br>
You may also use this list with https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock <br>
But I will be coming out with my own uBlock list soon.

This list is made from many sources. <br>
From: The Websites I visit & the App's I use<br>
but most of all I go out on the net looking for Ads & Trackers to block. (It's a Hobby) <br>
I've ran 100s of app over my andorid emulator logging all network traffic. <br>
I also handpick domain names to block that I find from other lists. <br>
When I do find a domain name I wish to block I then find all subdomains for that domain name<br>
by using various subdomain scanning tools. <br>
(Remember the wildcard character * only works in Microsoft Windows OS.)

Keep in mind that if you really like to watch videos on news websites,
then this list may not be for you. <br>
Some News sites like to hook Ad services into the video player code so by blocking one you break the other.üôÑ

Please report any issue with this list!!! <br>
Also if you have any feedback or want to help me out & suggestion a domain name or an App for me to look into Please do so. The more feed back I get the better I can make this list.

My message to Web-Admins/Webmasters: <br>
I hear some of you feel that blocking ads is like stealingüôÑ.<br>
Grow a brain it is not stealing! & blocking ads is like putting on a condom so I don't get hit by drive-by downloads trying to install a virus/malware. <br>
I feel if you people want to make moneyüí∞ off your website then make it private & make it a membership based website. <br>
Just remember you are not the only game in town, if you make it hard to view content when ads are blocked
I will just go find some other website to go to & never return to your website ever again. <br>
Remember I'm in Control of what shows up on My Screen let it be on my PC or my Smart Phone....
