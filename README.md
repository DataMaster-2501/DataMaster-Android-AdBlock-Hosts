# DataMaster-Android-AdBlock-Hosts

I made this list to fight the ever growing Ads within Android Apps.
I hate the fact that the Internet is turning into one big billboard!!
My message to Android Developers is: If you want to make $ then make people pay for your App.
If you want to make the App free then make it free you greedy pigs!!!!
I'm in Control of what shows up on my screen let it be on my PC or Phone....

This AdBlock /etc/hosts file is made for Android & Linux.
With Android & Linux you can't use the wildcard character * in the /etc/hosts file for Android & Linux,
that only works in Microsoft Windows OS.
So in Android & Linux you have to list the domain name & every subdomain name as well.ðŸ™„
As far as I know you have to be rooted on Android to be able to write to the /etc/hosts file.

This list blocks Ads, Analytics/Tracking Services, Websites/Services with a bad privacy policy.
With this list you can block ads within Android Apps & On Websites.
This file is setup for both IPv4 & IPv6.
You may also use this list with https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
But I will be coming out with my own uBlock list soon.

Keep in mind that if you really like to watch videos on news websites,
then this list may not be for you.
News sites like to hook Ad services into the video player code so by blocking one you break the other.

Please report any issue with this list!!
Also if you have any feedback or want to help me out & suggestion a domain name please do.
