# DataMaster-Android-AdBlock-Hosts

I made this list to fight the ever growing Ads within Android Apps.
I hate the fact that the Internet is turning into one big billboard!!

My message to: Android Developers is: If you want to make moneyðŸ’° then make people pay for your App.
If you want to make the App free then make it free with no Ads you Greedy Pigs!!!!
I'm in Control of what shows up on my screen let it be on my Phone or my PC....

This AdBlock /etc/hosts file is made for Android & Linux.
With Android & Linux you can't use the wildcard character * in the /etc/hosts file for Android & Linux,
that only works in Microsoft Windows OS.
So in Android & Linux you have to list the domain name & every subdomain name as well.ðŸ™„
As far as I know you have to be rooted on Android to be able to write to the /etc/hosts file
You do this with a root file manager or you can use adaway https://adaway.org/ (root need for adaway)

You can import my list into this Android App-> https://blokada.org/index.html you don't need root for Blokada. Also this list will work with AdClear but there is no import list option from what I can see.

This list blocks Ads/marketing services, Analytics/Tracking Services etc....
I feel the Analytics/Tracking Services that are added into Android Apps is a big privacy problem.
With this list you can block Ads within Android Apps & On Websites.
This file is setup for both IPv4 & IPv6.
You may also use this list with https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
But I will be coming out with my own uBlock list soon.

Keep in mind that if you really like to watch videos on news websites,
then this list may not be for you.
News sites like to hook Ad services into the video player code so by blocking one you break the other.ðŸ™„

Please report any issue with this list!!
Also if you have any feedback or want to help me out & suggestion a domain name or App to look at please do.

My message to Web-Admins/Webmasters: I hear some of you feel that blocking ads is like stealingðŸ™„.
Grow a brain it is not stealing!! & blocking ads is like putting on a condom so I don't get hit by drive-by downloads trying to install a virus/malware.
I feel if you people want to make moneyðŸ’° off your website then make it private & make it a membership based website.
Just remember you are not the only game in town, if you make it hard to view content when ads are blocked
I will just go find some other website to go to & never return to your website ever again.
Remember I'm in Control of what shows up on my screen let it be on my PC or my Smart Phone....
