# DataMaster-Android-AdBlock-Hosts
This AdBlock /etc/hosts file is made for Android & Linux.
With Android & Linux you can't use wildcard character * in the /etc/hosts file for Android & Linux,
that only works in Microsoft Windows OS.
So in Android & Linux you have to list the domain name & every subdomain name as well.ðŸ™„

This list blocks Ads, Analytics/Tracking Services, websites/services with a bad privacy policy.
With this list you can block ads within Android Apps & On Websites
This Hosts file setup for IPv4 & IPv6
You may also use this list with https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock

Keep in mind that if you really like to watch videos on news websites,
then this list may not be for you.
News site like to hook Ads service into the video player code so by blcoking one you brack the other.

Please repost any issise with this list what so ever!
Also if you have a feedback or want to help me out & suggestion a domain name please do.
